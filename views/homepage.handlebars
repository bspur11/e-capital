{{!-- The main.handlebars file used three curly brackets as {{{ body }}}, but here we're only using two brackets as {{ title }}. Why is that? The difference is that two brackets will convert HTML characters to strings. For instance, < would become &lt;. Three brackets, on the other hand, will render the data as HTML. --}}
